# My dotfiles!

Welcome! If you are reading this, then you came up to my personal dotfiles repository. Here I store all the stupid stuff that I try to do to my systems.
If you need help or anything, feel free to open an issue about it. Keep in mind that my configurations are designed to solve my problems with my specific hardware.
I can try to help you the best I can, but that's all.

Thanks!

## Prerequisites (TODO)
It is essential to have NixOs installed. That's it. The rest is on me.

## Installing (TODO)

## My personal computers (TODO)

### Spaceship
Spaceship is what I call my big monstruos desktop pc because it is basically a rocket.

### Framework
Framework is actually my recently bought Framework 13 notebook. It runs a AMD Ryzen 5 7640U. So, yeah, no Intel and thank god no NVIDIA.

## Launching Hyprland (TODO)
I don't start Hyprland when booting up because I don't always need a desktop to get through the day. That said, to start Hyprland simply run:

```console
foo@bar:~$ Hyprland
```

That's it. Enjoy!

## Setting up Wifi (TODO)
I am a very VERY lazy dude, so I didn't actually write any scripts to handle the network connection.
If you are using a Ethernet cable then just plug that shit in. If you are using the good old wifi, I recommend using the nmtui command to connect to your network.
Other than that, feel free to do whatever the hell you want. You are the protagonist of your own life.

## Development tools (TODO)

## Nixvim (TODO)
So, Nixvim is Neovim, but all of the config is done using Nix instead of Lua. I find nixvim pretty cool and I don't have to actually config anything, so that's a plus.
To run nixvim, just run neovim as always

```console
foo@bar:~$ nvim
```

Running vim also works ;) it's just an alias under the hood, so yeah

```console
foo@bar:~$ vim
```

## NVIDIA/AMD (TODO)
Jesus christ do I have to write shit here aswell? ffs

# My dotfiles!

Welcome! If you are reading this, then you came up to my personal dotfiles repository. Here I store all the stupid stuff that I try to do to my systems.
If you need help or anything, feel free to open an issue about it. Keep in mind that my configurations are designed to solve my problems with my specific hardware.
I can try to help you the best I can, but that's all.

Thanks!
